# pullstate-react

A really minimal starting point for my own React apps
using Parcel 2/Yarn/React/css-modules/Sass and of course,
lostpebble.github.io/pullstate.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the folder.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn run build`

## Future planned changes

- Automate this with a CI/CD pipeline and config.
